# JS Practice - Roman to Arabic Converter

Given a string containing a Roman numeral, write a function that returns it's Arabic equivalent.
```
exs. 
f("") = 0  
f("I") = 1  
f("X") = 10  
f("IX") = 9 
f("V") = 5
f('VIII')) = (8);
```

## Motivation

I'm used to using libraries to get projects off the ground, so I wanted some practice with just writing some JS from scratch. TDD was lightly followed using `chai` for assertions.  

I had this question in a job interview about a year ago and didn't solve it, so it was also good to review the problem.
