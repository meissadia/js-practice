# JS Practice

Given a string containing a Roman numeral, write a function that returns it's Arabic equivalent.

exs. 
f("") = 0
f("I") = 1
f("X") = 10
f("IX") = 9

## Motivation

Simply testing my ability to pick up a keyboard and write JS, given a node environment. I had this question in a job interview about a year ago and didn't solve it, so it was also good to review the problem.
